## The Mission

Vibe.co benefited from external expertise to help them implement Planhat in the best possible way by:

- Drafting a specialized customer team organization to better anticipate recruitment needs this year.
- Defining the best operational and business KPIs to monitor in order to better control team efficiency.
- Tracking the right usage data to trigger meaningful customer contacts.
- Clarifying the architecture of tools to better centralize information on customer contacts, whatever the channel (mail, chat, tel, other).

The mission was carried out in 3 phases:

### Phase 2

**Initial deployment & reaction based alerts on Planhat**

- Implement recommendations from phase 1 in Planhat;
- Connect their CRM (SFDC) and data warehouse into one unified system;
- Build a proactive approach by building a set of alerts based on KPI;
- Highlight underperforming accounts for CSMs to take actions;

### Phase 3

**Workflows & proactive management**

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives:

- Better monitor and improve proactive management for "at risk" accounts through dedicated workflows in Planhat;
